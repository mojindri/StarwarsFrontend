Project detail
- three api roots are provided (Planets, films, characters)
- Blazer server was used to implement the project 
- StarWarsApiCSharp library was also used in the project (explicitly integerated and changed due to some reasons)

Issues
- not properly available for release
- no image sources were available nor provided in order the visualize planet, film and character items in the api service,so only StarWar  picture wasused for all of the items
- https://swapi.dev/ services could be improved, if the service was able to return result by given series of the input(instead of single), which could lead to slowing down the   performance of the web application,
- cache mechanism was applicable, but due to some complications in API strucutre, this was disregarded
